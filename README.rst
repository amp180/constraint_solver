Example
-------

.. code:: python

	from amp_constraint_solver import solve


	def constraint1(b, **variables):
		return variables['a'] != 5 and b != 3


	constraint2 = lambda a, b: a != b


	for solution in solve({'a': [1, 5], 'b': [1, 2, 3]}, [constraint1, constraint2]):
	   print(solution)


prints:
